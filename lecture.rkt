all?, exists? - questions, may stop early.
filter, map - procedures, must iterate entire list.

DFS/BFS - are we solving an existance or universal problem.

Flag nodes: remember current path. 
    - breaks on DFS at first backtrack - we forget we've been there.

apply vs map ?!

BFS is built on levels, not in a queue!
